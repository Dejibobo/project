bash scripting 

YOU have to create a script something like script.sh
before you can excute command use 
chmod u+x "name of script"
to perform command on nano or vi
start with #!/usr/bin/bash
examples from class 
#!/usr/bin/bash

touch log_file.log
date >> log_file.log
free >> log_file.log
echo "---" >> log_file.log
 
example 2
if [[ -z "$1" ]]; then
echo "Empty Argument passed"
else 
echo "welcome $1"
fi

SYSTEMD(system) 
we worked with the command systemctl 
we use it to install apache2 and nginx 
it is use to check status,start, stop and restart running program
example sudo systemctl start apache2
note ssh works on port 21
ping is use for testing network connectivity
sudo ufw default deny outgoing 
sudo ufw default allow outgoing (allow user to get info from outside)
